"""Score bundle-store's tests for the `enabled` switch by breaking it on purpose.

The scoring engine — and the rules it enforces as refusals — lives in
scripts/sabotage.py. This file is only the case list: one edit per mechanism
the suite is meant to pin.

    python3 scripts/sabotage-enabled.py [--diffs] [--crosstable]

⚠️ **This is the engine's first copy outside scheduler.** It was landed there by
the 73rd pass and is meant to be the SAME BLOB everywhere it appears; the copy
in this repo is byte-identical at md5 `9d5ad6a0138c7f880f3f3c642166d80d`. If a
later pass finds these two disagreeing, they have forked, and the engine's own
header says what that costs. Diff before editing either.

Why this seam is worth a scorer: `enabled` is the only per-bundle switch the
service has, and until the 218th pass **nothing executed the code that writes
it**. A panic() at the first line of `Store.SetEnabled` or `handler.setEnabled`
left `go test ./...` green. The flag is written at two layers, read by a third
(`Resolve`, via `ListFilter.EnabledOnly`) and defended at a fourth
(`seedBundles`, which must not undo an operator's choice at every boot) — so the
mechanisms below deliberately cross all four files rather than sitting in one.

THREE targets, and that is deliberate. This flag is not a property of one file:
the store writes it, the server routes it, and the seed is the only thing
stopping a restart from reverting it. A scorer covering only store.go would put
a number on a third of the feature.

Case-writing rules inherited from the scheduler plans:

  - Prefer a DRIFTED VALUE to a deletion. It orphans no variable, needs no
    second edit, and is the likelier real-world regression.
  - Read every applied diff against its label (`--diffs`). A row prints the name
    you gave it, not the edit you made.
  - An UNNOTICED row is not automatically a coverage hole. It can be a
    behavioural no-op, or a fake in the test file that swallows the value the
    mutation moved.

Score when filed by the 218th pass: 18/18 real mechanisms caught, both controls
behaved, exit 0.

⚠️ Two of those 18 exist because the FIRST run of this file scored a false
UNNOTICED. The needle for SetEnabled's RowsAffected branch also matched
DeleteBundle, the engine's uniqueness guard counted files rather than
occurrences, and the row scored the wrong function while reading as a coverage
hole in the right one. Fixing the engine turned that row CAUGHT and exposed a
genuine unpinned branch in DeleteBundle, now its own case and its own test. An
UNNOTICED row is a claim about which line moved — check that before believing
it is a claim about the tests.

⚠️ `--crosstable` has NOT been taken for this repo, and no `unreddened`
declaration is made below, because an empty one would read as "measured and
found none" rather than "not measured". The next pass on this repo owns that.
Expect it to be large and mostly silent: `resolve_test.go` and `store_test.go`
predate this seam and cover code no case here touches, which is not a finding.

⚠️ Region this plan does NOT cover, declared rather than left to be
rediscovered. Every case below edits the enabled switch and the paths that read
it. `UpsertBundle`'s transaction, `resolveExtends`, `refuseInheritanceCycle`,
`DeleteBundle`'s ErrParentHasChildren guard, the member encode/decode helpers,
`memberIndex.lookup` and every route other than enable/disable are NOT sabotaged
here. That is the seam the 218th pass opened and nothing more; it is not a
statement that the rest is covered.
