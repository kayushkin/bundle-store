# Boot-and-answer smoke test for bundle-store.
#
# Builds cmd/bundle-store from THIS checkout, boots it against a throwaway SQLite
# file on a throwaway port, and drives real HTTP routes. Proves the committed
# tree produces a binary that BOOTS (a Go 1.22+ ServeMux route conflict panics at
# registration time — it compiles green and dies on start) and ANSWERS.
#
# "ANSWERS" here means POST /resolve, which is the only route with any real logic
# in it: select every enabled bundle that is named "base" or whose match_tags
# intersect the request's repo_tags, expand each through its `extends_id` chain
# ancestor-first, then drop members whose `condition` is not present in task_tags.
# A 200 from /health proves nothing about any of that, so this smoke drives the
# resolver directly — including the conditional gate, which is the part most
# likely to rot silently.
#
# A fresh database holds NO bundles: the service seeds nothing at boot. This
# smoke asserts the store starts empty, then creates through the API the base,
# react and go-service bundles its later steps resolve against. They are made
# up here, NOT copied from resolve_test.go, whose fixtures deliberately differ.
#
# Never touches live state: BUNDLE_STORE_DATA_DIR points at a throwaway
# directory, and Open("") would otherwise use the live default path and migrate
# it. HOME is redirected too, belt and braces.
#
# The server is a pure join over curated definitions and never reaches into
# skill-store or tool-store, so it boots with neither running — the smoke proves
# that. Only the -check-members pre-flight asks them, by id, whether every stored
# member still exists. The smoke stubs both stores on a throwaway port and runs
# that check against the bundles it created: once with every id present, once
# with a member renamed upstream (reported, not a failure), once with a member
# deleted upstream (a failure naming it), and once with the stores down.
#
# Exits 0 on success, non-zero on the first failing assertion; dumps the server
# log to stderr on failure.
#
# Tunables:
#   E2E_PORT — bundle-store listen port (default 19115)
#   E2E_STUB_PORT — stub skill-store/tool-store port (default E2E_PORT+1)
#   E2E_KEEP — set to "1" to leave $TMP_DIR around after the run
