// Package bundlestore is the canonical registry of curated session "bundles":
// named, inheritable sets of skills + tools (with optional model/effort
// defaults) that get selected for a session by repository and task tags. A
// bundle is a cross-store join artifact — its members are the ids skill-store
// and tool-store assigned, carried with the name alongside for display.
// bundle-store owns the curated definitions and the /resolve composition; it
// does not own the underlying skills/tools and is owned by no harness.
//
// Nothing in this package looks a member up by name. Names are not unique in
// skill-store, whose sources are separate upstream repositories, so the id an
// author supplies is the only thing that identifies a member. Whoever writes a
// bundle reads the id out of the owning store; see cmd/bundle-store for the
// one place on this side that turns a curated name into an id, and for how
// loudly it gives up when a name is ambiguous.

// Condition, if set, is a task tag that gates the member: it only takes effect
// when a resolve request's task_tags contain it, whether it includes or denies.
// Effect is MemberInclude or MemberDeny; a write that leaves it empty stores
// MemberInclude, and every read returns it filled in.

// Bundle is a curated definition. MatchTags select it against a repo/task tag
// set. DeniedReadPaths are path patterns a session given this bundle may not
// read: each starts with "/" or "~/", and may use "*" and "**" globs. They are
// plain paths, not any one harness's rule syntax; a harness wrapper turns them
// into its own form. ExtendsID points at a parent bundle whose members are inherited
// (ancestor members first, child overrides/extends). Model/Effort are optional
// session defaults; agent-store config wins on conflict (see README).
//
// ExtendsID is the inheritance link; Extends is the parent's name, carried
// alongside it for display exactly as Member.Name is. The chain walk reads
// ExtendsID and never Extends.
//
// On a write either one may be supplied. A caller that has the parent's id
// gives ExtendsID; a caller writing a definition by hand (a curl, a script)
// gives Extends, and UpsertBundle turns that name into an id once, against
// bundle-store's own bundles table, refusing the write if no such parent exists.
// Supplying both is only accepted when they agree — one fact arriving by two
// routes has to be checked, not silently resolved in favour of either.
